# gomoku
Gomoku (5-in-a-row) GUI, with a 2-player mode and a vs. AI mode. The AI utilizes negamax and alpha-beta pruning with Zobrist hashing. 

Inspired by the Tic-Tac-Toe Graphics Case Study found here: http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/JavaGame_TicTacToe.html#zz-3. Parts of the GUI components were taken and modified from this source.
