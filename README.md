Gomoku Game, Graphics, and AI Engine

Gomoku (5-in-a-row) GUI, available to play as either 2-player or with an AI utilizing negamax with alpha-beta pruning and Zobrist hashing.
Inspired by the Tic-Tac-Toe Graphics Case Study found here: http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/JavaGame_TicTacToe.html#zz-3.
Parts of the GUI components were taken and modified from this source.
